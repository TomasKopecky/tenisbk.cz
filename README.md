I've built the application using:
- PHP: Server-side scripting language.
- Nette: PHP framework for streamlined development.
- PostgreSQL: Robust database management system.
- JavaScript & jQuery: For interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

Frontend UI tools:
- AdminLTE: Dashboard and control panel template.
- DataTables: A jQuery plugin for table enhancement.

The web application is deployed on the ([tenisbk.cz](https://tenisbk.cz)) URL. The local development and testing is made on a XAMPP Apache server and Docker PostgreSQL container.

## Features üåü
**Current Features Include:**
- Comprehensive competition agenda management including players, clubs, registrations, matches, and more.
- Detailed sections for club tables, player rankings, match callendar, and more.
- A CMS for article management.

**Future Development Plans:**
- Upgrade to Nette 3 and PHP 8.0.
- Enhance the CMS to support custom image uploads for articles.
